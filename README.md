# Rick and Morty Characters App

## Overview

This iOS application fetches and displays character data from the Rick and Morty API. The app is designed to showcase a clean architecture approach, making the codebase modular, scalable, and testable. Users can browse through a list of characters and view detailed information about each character.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The primary programming language used for developing the app.
- **UIKit & SwiftUI**: Utilized for building the user interface.
- **Combine**: Used for handling asynchronous events and data binding.
- **Clean Architecture**: Implements the clean architecture principles to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Injection**: Used for managing dependencies and enhancing testability.


## Why Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture was chosen to ensure that the app is modular, testable, and maintainable. This approach provides several benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Testability**: The architecture allows for easier unit and integration testing by decoupling components.
- **Scalability**: The modular structure makes it easier to add new features without impacting existing functionality.
- **Flexibility**: Components can be easily replaced or updated without affecting other parts of the system.

### Assumptions
- Placeholder for assumptions made during the development process.
- Placeholder for any specific requirements or constraints considered.

## Challenges Faced

- Placeholder for challenges encountered while implementing the clean architecture.
- Placeholder for challenges with network handling and API integration.
- Placeholder for any UI/UX challenges.
